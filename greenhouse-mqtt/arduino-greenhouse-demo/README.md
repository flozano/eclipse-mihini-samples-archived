The code we use for providing the "Arduino Modbus simulator" is unfortunately not hosted at the Eclipse Foundation, and is available under the terms of GPLv3.

It is based on https://code.google.com/p/simple-modbus/ ; and the Arduino sketch you should put on your device is available there: https://github.com/kartben/mihini-greenhouse-demo/tree/master/SimpleModbusSlaveExample (it is a slightly tweaked version of the original example provided with simple-modbus)
